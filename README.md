# Adversarial Agents with Reinforcement Learning

## Section 1: Getting Started
### Intro


### Dependencies
```
torch==1.0.0
numpy==1.19.5
unityagents==0.4.0
```
### Relevant Folders
- `assets` contains the trained weight checkpoints organised in folders per algorithm
- `figures` contains the figures later shown in this document.
- `src` contains the implementation of the models

### Relevant Files
- `PPO_Continous_learning.ipynb` Is the notebook used to train the PPO model.
- `DDPG_Continous_learning.ipynb` Is the notebook used to train the DDPG model.
- `pretrained_demo.ipynb` Is the notebook used to load the pretrained models.

## Section 2: Download the Unity Environment
For this project, you will not need to install Unity - this is because we have already built the environment for you, and you can download it from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

- Linux: click [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
- Mac OSX: click [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): click [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): click [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

(For Windows users) Check out this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.


**NB To use the code as is, please import the environments in the unity folder**
